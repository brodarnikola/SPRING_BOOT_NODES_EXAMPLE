Pseudo Code for SQL Database Access

Fetching nodes under a parent:
SELECT * FROM locationNode WHERE parent_node_id = ? ORDER BY ordering;

Inserting a new node:
INSERT INTO locationNode (title, parent_node_id, ordering)
VALUES (?, ?, ?);

Updating a node's title:
UPDATE locationNode SET title = ? WHERE id = ?;

Deleting a node and its children:
DELETE FROM locationNode WHERE id = ?;

Moving a node to a new parent:
UPDATE locationNode SET parent_node_id = ?, ordering = ? WHERE id = ?;

Reordering nodes:
UPDATE locationNode SET ordering = ? WHERE id = ?;
